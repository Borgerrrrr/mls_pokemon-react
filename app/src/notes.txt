dex api:
https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokedex/{id or name}/
pokemon:
https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{id or name}/
species api:
https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-species/{id or name}/

notes:
use species-api to get id associated to name, then use pokemon-api to get full details using id from before

todo:
- process data when loading a new pokedex into local store. local store should be fully functional without having to keep fetching data (unless for detailed view)
  - might want to eventually export json processor into a util so it can work for /regions page too
- style pokedex a bit. check if rerenders are doing ok
- handle search
